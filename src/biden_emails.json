    "body": "Shameful. Just shameful… Team, Republicans are conspiring right now to steal the 2026 midterm elections. They know how unpopular their agenda is, especially after passing a budget bill that will hurt millions of families. So instead of trying to win on the issues, they’re changing the rules — making it harder to vote in states across the country and gerrymandering districts to keep themselves in power. They’re hoping we won’t notice — or worse, that we won’t fight back. But we’ve got news for them: We’re not going to let that happen. Democrats are organizing in every state to protect voting rights, fight back against Republican power grabs, and win elections up and down the ballot. But we can’t do it without your help. Can you pitch in $3 or whatever you can afford to help Democrats fight back against these attacks on our democracy and win in 2026? [link removed] Thank you, The Democrats"

    "body": "Team, news on the key Virginia governor’s race (our only chance to flip a governor's seat this year) — the GOP’s candidate took money from a known Nazi sympathizer. Her campaign claims she didn’t know. But that’s not an excuse — not when we’re talking about someone who wants to be the next governor of Virginia. We’re talking about a person who has supported near-total abortion bans, downplayed the devastating impact of federal layoffs in Virginia, and now, refuses to return campaign donations from someone who has supported a neo-Nazi. There’s no ambiguity here. We can’t afford to let this person become the next governor of Virginia. Democrats have the opportunity to flip this seat — but we need to move fast. Republicans and MAGA groups are already pouring money into this race, and the general election campaign is officially underway.

    "body": "We're nearly halfway through the month, which means we are nearly halfway to our next FEC deadline — and we're still short of our mid-month goal. Every FEC deadline is a chance to show the strength of our grassroots movement and prove that the Democratic Party has what it takes to win in 2025, 2026, and beyond. But we're not there yet — and if we fall short this time, it will send the wrong message. Here's why this is so important: This week alone, House Republicans advanced legislation that would gut health care and food assistance for tens of millions of Americans. Republicans in the Senate are trying to pass a bill that would make it harder for people to vote. And Donald Trump is continuing to wage war on our democracy, launching attacks on anyone who dares to hold him accountable. That's the future they're fighting for — and we can't afford to let them win. It's up to all of us to fight back, organize everywhere, and elect Democrats who will actually represent the people. If you're with us, we’re asking you to make a contribution to the DNC ahead of our FEC deadline to help us reach our goal and continue building the infrastructure to win.

    "body": "Good morning — we hope you won’t scroll past this short read. Over the weekend, Trump and Republicans pushed one of the most extreme budget bills in modern American history — and young people took notice. Their bill would gut our health care system, slash food assistance, cut access to education and job training, eliminate affordable housing support, and put our environment in jeopardy. That’s not speculation. That’s in the bill. It’s no wonder young voters are furious. They turned out in record numbers in 2020, 2022, and again in 2024 to protect health care, climate action, reproductive freedom, and economic opportunity. And Trump and Republicans are attacking all of it. Trump and Republicans are terrified of young people’s power at the ballot box. And they should be. That’s why they’re pushing this reckless bill behind closed doors and spreading lies about what it actually does. But this community sees right through it — and we won’t let it slide. The Democratic Party is already working hard to organize young voters all across the country.

    "body": "Team, we’re reaching out to ask if you’d make a contribution to the DNC by midnight tonight. Not tomorrow, not next week, but tonight. Here’s the deal: In just shy of six months in office, Trump has: Enacted a disastrous economic agenda that has increased costs for working people and families. Pushed his catastrophic budget bill through Congress (with the help of his GOP allies), which will kick 17 million Americans off their health care and strip families nationwide of access to food assistance. Fired government workers from critical agencies, including from NOAA, NWS, and FEMA, which folks across the country rely on for lifesaving weather advisories ahead of major weather events — and aid in the aftermath. Sowed chaos in California by deploying the National Guard — an unprecedented step that bypassed the authority of Governor Gavin Newsom. Deported folks to a Salvadorian prison without due process, and constructed an inhumane holding center in Florida — ripping apart families and threatening entire communities. Democrats are fighting back. But we have to do more than just resist Trump’s agenda. Here at the DNC, we’re working hard to build the long-term infrastructure we need to get Democrats elected up and down the ballot, all across the country, this year and beyond. If we want to successfully fight back against Trump and his Republican allies, we need to elect leaders who will push back against the administration and work hard to defend their cities, districts, and states. But in order to do that, we need your help tonight. In order to win big across the country and fight back against the GOP agenda, we need to cultivate resources early — the more contributions we receive now, the more effective we can be in the long term, investing in state parties nationwide and organizing millions of voters so that we have the strongest base possible when we need it most. We’re already doing the work to elect Democrats in this year’s New Jersey and Virginia races, and we’ll continue to do the work to flip Congress in 2026 and take back the White House in 2028. So please, use this link to make a donation to the DNC tonight so we can continue to fight for Democrats who will fight for you >> Thank you for standing with us, The Democrats"

Americans overwhelmingly do not want to go to war. Americans do not want to risk the safety of our troops abroad.

    "body": "Last week, I was physically and aggressively forced out of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s press conference for trying to ask a question. By now, you may have seen the video. Before I even asked my question, I was pushed and pulled, and struggled to maintain my balance. I was forced to the ground first on my knees and then flat on my chest, and as I was handcuffed and marched down a hallway, I repeatedly asked, “Why am I being detained?” I went to that press conference because I was doing my job as a United States Senator — to provide oversight and accountability of the Trump administration. But if you watched what unfolded last week and thought that was about one politician or one press conference, then you’re missing the point. If that’s how this administration responds to a United States senator with a question, what will they do to hardworking Americans raising their voices in California and around the country? If our elected officials become too afraid to speak up, how can we expect any other American to do the same? Right now, Donald Trump would love nothing more than for all of us to just cower away and say nothing, and let him continue to abuse his power. I won’t do that. And I hope you won’t either. If you’re with me, I hope you’ll consider splitting a contribution between my campaign and the DNC. It is more important than ever that we come together and stand against Trump and his allies’ abuse of power.

Let us explain: There’s an important runoff election happening this weekend that’s flying under the radar — but the outcome will directly impact more than one million people in one of the largest cities in our country. In San Antonio, voters are about to head to the polls to elect their next mayor. Republicans are laser-focused on this race, and we need to be, too. One MAGA-aligned group is funding voter contact and advertising efforts targeting San Antonio voters. That makes a big difference — especially in an election that could very well come down to turnout. Texas Democrats need the resources to fight back and reach as many voters in this election and those to come. Can you make a $10 split donation between the Texas Democratic Party and DNC to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot? Republicans are backing a candidate who — as Texas Secretary of State — had to be blocked from handing Texans’ voter registration information over to Trump. It’s clear who he’s working for — and it’s not the people of San Antonio. That’s why it’s so important we win this race, and it’s why we’re committed to investing as much as we can to ensure Democrats have the resources they’ll need in Texas for this election and those to come. We know you may not have opened this email planning to help fund this work, but we hope this explanation helped.

This is just Trump's latest attempt at political retaliation against his perceived enemies. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) via Truth Social: 'I have always suspected Shifty Adam Shiff was a scam artist. And now I learn that Fannie Mae's Financial Crimes Division have concluded that Adam Schiff has engaged in a sustained pattern of possible Mortgage Fraud. Adam Schiff said that his primary residence was in Maryland to get a cheaper mortgage and rip off America, when he must live in California because he was a Congressman from California. I always knew Adam Schiff was a Crook. The fraud began with the refinance of his Maryland property on February 6, 2009, and continued through multiple transactions until the Maryland property was correctly designated as a second home on October 13, 2020. Mortgage Fraud is very serious, and crooked Adam Schiff (now a Senator) needs to be brought to justice.'
